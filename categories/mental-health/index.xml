&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="how-it-happened"&gt;How It Happened
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It happened at some point between starting school and stopping my original anxiety medication abruptly. I had no choice, as my husband lost his job and the insurance with it, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see a doctor or get emergency doses in my state. A few months after going cold-turkey from that medication, my anxiety started ramping up, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think straight, my mind was a mental prison, literally. Getting high made it worse, drinking made it worse, sleeping was my only relief but my mind wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let me rest enough. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep a lid on the anxiety. My hand tingles: anxiety. My hearing rings: anxiety. &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; set it off. So, eating wasn&amp;rsquo;t on my radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started with school, I started getting busy and walking more, to and from school, pride events, etc. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much of an appetite, so I stopped eating full meals, and started eating less than half of a normal meal. At the worst of it, I was only eating 600 - 900 calories a day, when my baseline should be around 1200 calories. When I first moved to my college city, I weighed about 130 lbs. At the end of my eating disorder, I weighed only 108 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-it-hurt-me"&gt;How It Hurt Me
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time I felt shitty, my husband would always ask me, &amp;ldquo;Have you eaten enough? You need to eat.&amp;rdquo; The whole time, he knew it was getting worse, he knew how little I was eating. Almost daily, he would check in with me and see if I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten enough, he even got me an app to track my calorie intake. When I saw how little I was consuming, I cried to him, feeling so guilty for worrying him. I thought I was fine, that I was in control of it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel much different than normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the heart issues started. I started getting palpitations almost a dozen times a day. One medication for IBS caused my heart to frequently send me to the ER. After I got off that medication, my heart stopped hitting 180bpm, but I would still get adreneline dumps in the middle of the night, or I&amp;rsquo;d have to lay down to equilise my blood pressure a couple times a day. I had no energy, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle the heat of summer and almost got heat sickness any time I went camping (the heat never went above 90°). My husband and I went on a two week road trip up to the west coast, and I was so malnourished that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have energy to explore, bike, hike, or anything. I almost had no energy for sex. It was humiliating, and concerning. I thought my heart was giving me a million issues all of a sudden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still wasn&amp;rsquo;t eating enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-i-got-better"&gt;How I Got Better
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seeing my cardiologist a second time, she suggested I see a nutritionist. Thankfully, she wasn&amp;rsquo;t booked out and I could see her within the week. And that appointment &lt;em&gt;crushed&lt;/em&gt; me. I gave her all the information, and my husband filled in the blanks &amp;ndash; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t eating enough, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t eating fruits or veggies, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t eating enough meat. The nutritionist asked me if I ever had an eating disorder before, and that took me by surprise. She then told me, &amp;ldquo;You are in mild starvation right now. Any worse and your body will start failing you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I broke down. I was failing my body. I was failing myself. Worst of all, I was failing my husband, and I was making him scared for my health. We both cried over this appointment. He was scared for my health, for my safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made a plan, and got to shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focused on high-calorie ready-to-eat and frozen meals, and I ordered a large amount of soylent meal-replacement smoothies. On top of that, we got a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of snacks, especially bread-y and fattening goodies, as that was something else I stopped eating completely. If you know me, you know I &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have a snack nearby, in my purse, etc. I never usually go without a snack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-im-doing-now"&gt;How I&amp;rsquo;m Doing Now
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten so much better so quickly! I am currently 118 lbs, I have energy to walk, run, and explore things. I&amp;rsquo;m eating an almost perfectly balanced diet, and we&amp;rsquo;ve decided that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what kind of food I eat (fast food vs home-cooked) as long as I have color on my plate (meat, veggies, etc) and I&amp;rsquo;m eating at least 2/3 of each meal. Now, I am able to eat an entire McDonalds burger, or a whole 12-piece nugget from Chik-fil-a. I&amp;rsquo;m still not able to eat a whole fast food meal, with the entree and the fries, but I at least can finish the entire entree while eating a little bit of the side dish. I am also less picky about leftover meals, and can eat those whenever I feel hungry. I am also no longer having scary health issues! I rarely have heart palpitations, my heart doesn&amp;rsquo;t randomly race anymore, and I&amp;rsquo;m able to work out without getting dizzy and light-headed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m proud of myself for getting my health back to where it should be. It was causing so much depression and distress for myself that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t physically or mentally handle doing the things I love. It&amp;rsquo;s so important that you figure out where your priorities lie, and if your health isn&amp;rsquo;t at the top of that list, you need to rearrange &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. We deserve to live a long, healthy, and &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt; life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodnight, ttfn 💖&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Drama Llama!</title><link>https://melblogs.online/p/drama-llama/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melblogs.online/p/drama-llama/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://melblogs.online/p/drama-llama/cover2.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Drama Llama!" /&gt;&lt;h3 id="oh-the-drama"&gt;Oh, The Drama!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, now that I&amp;rsquo;ve had a healthy discussion with my husband and we both had our mini-mental-breakdowns, we&amp;rsquo;re both feeling more level-headed. I also apologize to you, Dear Reader, for my very random outburst; Our apartment is incredibly cluttered and FULL of everyones crap, and it is getting all of us to a breaking point. I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to my two friends, and they&amp;rsquo;ve agreed that this week we will all do a small part to help tidy up the main living space, and once this week is over, we will all start condensing all of our stuff into storage and give ourselves as much space as possible. We have until the end of February to live in this tiny apartment, so we&amp;rsquo;ve gotta make our lives as easy as possible, and keep the negative effects on our mental health as little as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, we are SO CLOSE to finishing our quarter!! We are all SO tired, and SO excited to be done. Today, we are finishing our separate project presentations for one class, and we&amp;rsquo;ve all finished our exams, so after today we&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to work on!! Yippeeeee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-change-of-topic---my-childhood-vs-me-today"&gt;A Change Of Topic - My Childhood VS Me Today
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does my current lifestyle reflect my childhood?&lt;/strong&gt;
Short answer: hell no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer answer? My current lifestyle is full of love, respect, communication, and education thanks to amazing friends and my found family. I mainly have my husband to thank for the early-lifestyle change; He encouraged me to go back to therapy, taught me what proper healthy communication looks and sounds like. Thanks to him, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that when I am frustrated, overstimulated, or angry with someone or something, I am allowed to step away and cool off and I deserve uninterruption. The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; person in my life that has disrespected this boundary is my mother, and she is no longer in my life. Over the last ten years, I have been working to perfect my communication skills and keeping a level head, I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten into any painful arguments with anyone. Any time my husband and I, or any of my friends or siblings and I, have some miscommunications or hurt feelings, we all feel safe enough to approach each other for a calm and meaningful discussion to get back on the same page and resolve any lingering tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also made a lot of friends, people who share my experiences as a child and teenager and have similar mental illnesses. These friends have taught me so much, and helped me recognize my toxic patterns, and also helped me see the value in myself. They taught me what boundaries are important, and how to uphold them safely. Because I was able to create and uphold my boundaries, I was able to disown my mother, and I don&amp;rsquo;t visit my family often in order to avoid triggering my anger and anxiety. As a child, I was bullied quite harshly by not only school kids, but by my older siblings and mother. Today, I have such strong boundaries that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t phase me if anyone tries to bully me as an adult, instead I either shut them down, or I allow it to go over my head and ignore it. However, if someone I care about is getting bullied, I immediately get active with it (which is made easier by being actively in college). I tell any advisors of the situation and keep track of it and on their case until it gets resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s another thing &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m in college!! My second year out of 3 at that. Younger me &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; thought this was going to happen; Strictly because I was told by family members that I would never get this far, I would always be a failure. Thanks to a safer and healthier environment, I know that that isn&amp;rsquo;t true. I&amp;rsquo;ve succeeded in areas that those people could never reach (and only because they would never let themselves get that far). I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so much, and I&amp;rsquo;m thankful I was able to find anxiety medication when I did&amp;hellip; My memory is getting better, along with my self-confidence. I&amp;rsquo;m able to memorize things I code and learn better, and during my three week break I&amp;rsquo;m going to be learning how to use React and NextJS, which I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to specialize in, along with Typescript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what else to write about regarding this 😅 If you stayed to read this far, thank you!! I&amp;rsquo;ll see you next time :)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Today Kinda Sucks</title><link>https://melblogs.online/p/today-kinda-sucks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melblogs.online/p/today-kinda-sucks/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://melblogs.online/p/today-kinda-sucks/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Today Kinda Sucks" /&gt;&lt;h3 id="just-today"&gt;Just Today
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today started out pretty good, me and two friends went on a day trip to pick up some things that my friends needed. Then I helped one of them pack up their stuff from their school apartment and bring it to my place (we&amp;rsquo;ll be putting most of it in storage this week). I packed up almost all of my yarn except for the bits I think I&amp;rsquo;d use between now and February, which is when my husband, my two friends, and I move into a hopefully not expensive house together to save costs for all of us. All of us being in one 900sqft apartment has taught me that getting overstimulated is a lot easier, and that my mental health isn&amp;rsquo;t as good as I thought it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="borderline-personality-disorder"&gt;Borderline Personality Disorder
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have BPD; Not bi-polar, but borderline. People who have BPD usually get it through complex-PSTD, which I also have. That C-PTSD usually stems from childhood abuse and/or neglect, which I went through. How does this tie in to things today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ties in by affecting my originally great and fun mood and tanking it down to the floor with the flip of a switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, this happened because of a mix of things. One friend was being too stupid and goofy under the influence, poking me and poking my pimple and being clingy, I was overwhelmed with how much shit is suddenly in our apartment taking up space, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my husband doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand how these two friends and I treat each other (because he isn&amp;rsquo;t with us all day at school) so he contantly, and seriously, keeps telling me I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;being too hard&amp;rdquo; on them and I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;being too mean/ too much&amp;rdquo; to them. So, thanks to BPD, I am not only resenting my husband because of his blind bullshit, but he&amp;rsquo;s making me resent having my friends as friends. I resent giving up my daybed for my friends to sleep in because now I can&amp;rsquo;t have a night alone to cool off and get away from &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m seriously considering sleeping in my car tonight, damn the consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as a way of coping with these feelings, I am alone in my bedroom until everyone goes to bed and my husband comes into the bedroom and we inevitably have a chat, writing this blog post. Here&amp;rsquo;s to hoping it helps, because so far nothing&amp;rsquo;s changed and I still want to cry and fight everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyways. goodnight.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>https://melblogs.online/p/first-post/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melblogs.online/p/first-post/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://melblogs.online/p/first-post/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post First Post" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is Thanksgiving 2025. It is 1:41pm and 55°F, which is wonderfully chilly. I&amp;rsquo;m going to a friend&amp;rsquo;s house with my husband and another friend, to spend Thanksgiving dinner with this friend and his family. &lt;br&gt;
I want to take a second to give space to all of the Native American tribes that were abused, murdered, kidnapped, and ultimately changed by settlers who took everything from Native people. You all deserve peace, to have your land back, and to have your languages back and your pre-colonial history not forgotten or erased. &lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t really celebrate Thanksgiving, because of its history. My only &amp;ldquo;celebration&amp;rdquo; is the excuse to see friends (like this friend) who I don&amp;rsquo;t usually get to see outside of special occasions and holidays, due to both parties being too busy on a normal basis. &lt;br&gt;
It feels like with adulthood comes the lack of care for holidays. I tried to hold onto it, the childhood magic that your family desperately holds onto for you and your cousins. However, growing up came with living across the country from the rest of your family, which then comes with never seeing your relatives (and never messaging or trying to see each other because neither of you seem to care at all), and over the years you end up feeling estranged from everyone. Thankfully I still keep up with one cousin and my younger brother, and they both keep up with me (and I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; thankful for them!) &lt;br&gt;
Anyways, this blog is going to be my way of processing life. I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to go to therapy yet, as my school schedule is so busy, but I know I still need to be responsible to myself and take care of my mental health. So, I will be talking about college and things I learn and struggle with, exciting things that happen (like how I was elected to the Unified Student Government), vacations, things with friends, drama, and personal things like how I saw a nutritionist and was told I was in &amp;ldquo;mild starvation&amp;rdquo; and how horrified I was. If you took the time to read all of this, thank you, and I hope you stick around for my other posts &amp;lt;3.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
