### Day So Far
Hello and holy shit it's *only* Thursday... It has been a WEEK and the damn things not even over yet. I've had to stay up past midnight 3 nights in a row when my bedtime is 10pm, so I've been running on 6ish hours of sleep for three days. I am finally all caught up on each assignment (thank goodness I wasn't that far behind)! However, crunch time hasn't ended and won't end until around December 11th or 12th. I have a breakfast meeting with the president of my school for the USG meeting at freaking 9AM tomorrow morning, which means I don't get to sleep in like usual. Then I have calculus in the afternoon for an hour. THEN I get to relax and study until a USG team bonding event at 6pm which could go on past 9pm. Then I have my math exam at 1pm Saturday. 🫠 My anxiety meds are the only reason why I haven't given up at this current point of exhaustion. It's 7:22pm right now, and I definitely think I'm going to shower soon and get to bed by 10pm again. 
#### Calculus
Sooo... I'm failing calculus!!  

I'm already weak with math in general, but calculus is a whole new demon. Even my three smartest classmates keep getting confused and stuck on these problems. I haven't given up, but I do only have one week left, so I'm going to shift my focus to my other classes, as well as setting myself up with an online calculus course that will be overall cheaper than a weekly tutoring session. Now that I at least have some calculus under my belt, I know I'm at least going to have better luck this time around. I'm doing this online course because my student advocate suggested it, and she said if I complete the course with a passing grade, I can easily transfer the credits and I won't have to retake the class at all! I'm incredibly grateful for her, she understands and told me that this is one of the three most failed courses (english comp and educational learning theories being the other two.. because students are lazy as hell). I was pretty broken up about failing this class, but it's comforting to know that it won't effect the rest of my degree. 
#### English Comp
I recently wrote a research paper about billionaires and their effect on the environment, as well as how technology can help slow climate change AND hold billionaires accountable. Did you know, there is a technology called Blockchain that hosts software that can track corporations and companies carbon emissions, and they get "carbon credits" when they hit their carbon emisson reduction goals?? That's freaking awesome! There was also a satellite called the MethaneSAT, which would view the Earth and track the source of carbon emissions, and track *who* was emitting the most carbon and methane!! Technology is freaking amazing, and I'm so grateful for the opportunity to become a software engineer!

Anywho..... It's 11:15pm and past my bedtime :D yippeeeee
