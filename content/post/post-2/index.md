## My Last 3 Days So Far
Hello, all! \
It's a new day, and this is my first post post-thanksgiving (hehe)! I slept pretty badly last night (as per the last few nights) but I got to take a 2 hour nap, and was then invited on a bike ride with my husband and our roommate D! This was D's first time riding a road bike specifically, and to be honest, he did just fine. He was especially nervous about riding with drop handlebars, but over the weeks I guess he'd gotten used to the idea, and he did awesome! It was funny though, I was leading the trail with D behind me and my husband at the back (because he's the fastest and most experienced), and about 3 times D had either fallen into a chain-link fence (which saved him from *actually* falling) or he hand nearly fallen but caught himself, and all of this happened because he was going too slow while waiting for me to go ahead of him... lol. 

But anywho! We also stopped at the local skate park/ shop nearby, after finding out on Instagram that a local mutual aid organization is collecting winter clothing and survival items for our homeless community, and dropped off seven fluffy crochet beanies I made earlier this year. I can't wait to make more, and I might make a couple warm blankets or mittens and scarves. Last thing we did together today was stop at Trek to buy D a helmet that fits (he's got a pretty thick noggin), and grab food at the mall on our way home. D, by the way, is unofficially our roommate, as he and another friend will be moving in with us in a couple months. So tonight, D stayed back at their place to play games with friends. 
### Class Research - Billionaires Suck
I just got done doing research on how to hold billionaires accountable to slow down the climate crisis, and successfully found *two* reliable papers... I might have to expand my research juuuust a touch. Thankfully my calculus homework is done minus the very last question, and yes I do in fact still hate math (you can't convince me to like it, I'm dealing with anti-derivatives). I am officially mostly caught up on homework! If I haven't mentioned it yet, I am a 29 year old college student in my second year of college, I have two best friends who are 10 years younger (yes, it's weird, and yes, I have communicated that unequal power dynamics make me super uncomfy, they have agreed to let me know if things change in a bad way) and my degree is software engineering! 
### A Late Intro
I am also a part of the LGBTQ community, I go by they/them pronouns, and I feel a **very** strong sense of justice! If human rights, animals, the LGBTQ, respecting insects, and our climate crisis don't align with your beliefs, then we will not appreciate each other and you are not welcome to continue reading (although I can't stop you).
### World News - Palestine
Speaking of world-news, have you heard the new movie / documentary coming out? It's called "*The Voice of Hind Rajab*". I haven't watched it past the trailor, and I still cried. I remember vividly when the news of her murder came out, what those people had put her through. Wesam Rajab, Hind's mother, has become an advocate for the children of Gaza who all have died, or are dying and fearing for their lives. All children deserve to be free of the fate that was forced onto Hind. And NO, there is no such thing as Palistinians being trained soldiers from *literal* ***birth***. That is what the people YOU hate want you to believe, and you're straight falling for it. Anyways. 
### US News - MMIW
Also, in American news, [the Trump admin removed an important report on MMIW](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-admin-removes-report-on-missing-native-americans-11063830). MMIW means "Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women [and children]. The report is called Not One More, and the senator who was part of the commitee to introduce the 2020 Not Invisible Act had noticed it disappeared from the DOJ's website. This is huge, because not only is MMIW a very ignored American crisis, but it just shows that this Admin *does not care about the MMIW crisis*. Instead, a DOJ spokesperson was quoted saying the report was removed to "ensure compliance" to an executive order, which then states "women are biologically female, and men are biologically male." ...What that has to do with MMIW, I have no fucking idea. 

So now, not only are Native Americans and Native Alaskans still being politically abused and ignored, but they're quickly being erased in a violent way. This will allow *even more* Indigenous women and children to go missing and/or turn up murdered, and no one will be forced to care, again. 

We should all be angry about this. Goodnight.
