Hello again! Yesterday was a particularly relaxing day; We all woke up to snow and sleet, and 33&deg;F, barely breezy! Definitely too cold for a bike ride. Productivity was low, but laundry got half done (still gotta fold it...), dishes got done (thank you, hubby!) and the blog was edited. I started learning how to knit after I've been crocheting for the last five years, and I honestly love it so far! I got myself used to casting the yarn onto the needles, creating a "magic join" so I can work in the round, and I am now making my first hat! It is taking some time, but I'm hoping it will still be faster than using crochet. With this new skill, I'm hoping making things like hats, socks, and sweaters will be easier and faster than crocheting them (also, crochet socks SUUUCK!).
